# # About Dataset

# - The data refers to Daily prices of various commodities in India of all the states and districts. It has the wholesale maximum price, minimum price and modal price on daily basis. This dataset is generated through the AGMARKNET Portal (http://agmarknet.gov.in), which disseminates daily market information of various commodities.
# 
# According to the AGMARKNET Portal, the prices in the dataset refer to the wholesale prices of various commodities per quintal (100 kg) in Indian rupees. The wholesale price is the price at which goods are sold in large quantities to retailers or distributors.
# 
# - Features of the dataset include:
# 
# - State: The state in India where the market is located.
# - District: The district in India where the market is located.
# - Market: The name of the market.
# - Commodity: The name of the commodity.
# - Variety: The variety of the commodity.
# - Grade: The grade or quality of the commodity.
# - Min Price: (INR) The minimum wholesale price of the commodity on a given day, per quintal (100 kg).
# - Max Price: (INR) The maximum wholesale price of the commodity on a given day, per quintal (100 kg).
# - Modal Price: (INR) The most common or representative wholesale price of the commodity on a given day, per quintal (100 kg).
# - 1 INR = 0.012 USD (as on 7 July, 2023)

# # Market analysis: 
# You can use this dataset to analyze trends and patterns in the wholesale prices of various commodities across different markets in India. This can help you understand factors that affect prices, such as supply and demand, seasonality, and market conditions.
# # Commodity recommendation:
# Develop recommender systems that suggest the best markets or commodities for farmers or traders to sell or buy based on their location, preferences, and market conditions.

# 1. Understand price trends to forecast future movements and make informed purchasing and pricing decisions.
# 
# 2. Compare commodity prices across regions to identify market opportunities and optimize supply chain management.
# 
# 3. Analyze seasonal patterns to forecast demand fluctuations and adjust production and inventory strategies.
# 
# 4. Gain market intelligence to anticipate changes, mitigate risks, and make proactive decisions.
# 
# 5. Conduct competitive analysis to evaluate pricing advantages and develop competitive strategies.
# 
# 6. Optimize prices based on historical data and market conditions to maximize revenue.
# 
# 7. Manage risks associated with price fluctuations by developing risk management strategies.
# 
# 8. Evaluate suppliers based on historical price performance to make informed selection decisions.
# 
# 9. Understand customer behavior and preferences related to commodity prices to tailor marketing strategies.

# 
# * PRICE DISTRIBUTIONS~
# - Overview- Min Price (36.4%), Max Price (22.0%) and Modal Price (41.5%).
# 
# - we will choose Modal Price for further evaluation, Modal Price represent the most common wholesale price of the commodity on   given day, per quintal (100 kg).
# 
# - Find out the top 10 highest modal price.
# 
# - Kerala contribute the highest Modal Price whereas Gujrat, NCT Delhi and Rajasthan have almost equal contribution.
# 
# - Kattappana (Kerala) market has highest modal price.
# 
# - Cardamoms commodity has highest modal price, whereas cloves, jeera and fish have also modal price.
# 
# - Other variety has highest Modal Price while jeera's variety has second.
# 
# - Almost all the Modal Price falls under 20,000.Modal Price is correlated with Max Price and Min Price.
